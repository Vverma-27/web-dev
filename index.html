            <h3 class="title">Covid Research undertaken by scientists</h3>
            <p class="para">Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded Indian scientists for developing made-in-India vaccine against Covid and boosting other measures to fight the pandemic within a year of its outbreak.
                <br> Addressing a meeting of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Society via video conferencing, he cited India's experience in the previous century to say that it used to wait for years to lay its hands on innovations
                achieved abroad, but its scientists are now working shoulder to shoulder with their counterparts outside.
                <br> They are working at the same quick pace, he said.
                <br> Noting that the world is grappling with the biggest challenge in a century, the prime minister praised the scientific community, saying it is perhaps unprecedented that vaccines were prepared within a year. On the occasion, Mr. Modi
                reiterated his call for an "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" (Self-reliant) and strong India, saying the COVID-19 crisis may have slowed its pace but our resolve remains the same.

            <p class="para">
                Take care of yourself. Get a good night’s rest and hydrate well before your vaccination so you can feel your best on the day.
                <br> If you have any questions about whether you should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, speak to your doctor. At present, people with the following health conditions should not receive a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid any possible adverse effects:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li">If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of a COVID-19 vaccine.</li class="li">
                    <li class="li">If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (although you can get vaccinated once you have recovered and your doctor has approved).</li>

            <h3 class="title">Instructions to heed during vaccination</h3>
            <p class="para">After you’ve been vaccinated Stay for monitoring. The health care provider should observe you for about 15 minutes after the vaccine is administered to make sure you don’t have any immediate reactions. However, it is extremely rare for severe
                health reactions. Be prepared for some side effects. Vaccines are designed to give you immunity without the dangers of getting the disease. While it’s normal to build immunity without side effects, it’s also common to experience some mild-to-moderate
                side effects that go away within a few days on their own. Some of the mild-to-moderate side effects you may experience after vaccination include:
                <ul>
                    <li class="li">Arm soreness at the injection site</li>
                    <li class="li">Mild fever</li>
                    <li class="li"> Fatigue</li>
                    <li class="li"> Headaches</li>
                    <li class="li"> Muscle or joint aches </li>
                    <li class="li"> Chills</li>
                    <li class="li"> Diarrhoea</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                If any symptoms continue for more than a few days or if you experience a more severe reaction, then contact your health care provider immediately. Be patient. Building immunity takes time. You will be considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your second
                dose. Keep yourself and others safe. While these vaccines are showing to be highly effective at protecting people against serious illness from COVID-19, we’re still learning about whether it is possible for a vaccinated person to still
                spread the virus, even without symptoms. Therefore, it is important to continue practicing safety precautions to protect yourself and others, including avoiding crowded spaces, physical distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask .</p>

                <p class="answer">Fact – NO, antibiotics cannot treat viral infection. They are used to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. The Coronavirus strain – 2019-nCoV belongs to a large family of viruses and, therefore antibiotics cannot be the preventive measure.</p>

                <p class="answer">Fact – People from all age group are susceptible to coronavirus infection. However, older people and people suffering from medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or any heart disease, or with low immunity are more vulnerable to this

                    Fact – NO, the vaccine used for pneumonia does not provide any protection against the coronavirus infection. COVID-19 is a new virus and researchers are trying to develop an effective vaccination for the same. But, currently, we have no vaccine for coronavirus.</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Fact :None of these recommendations protects you from getting COVID-19, and some of these practices may be dangerous. The best ways to protect yourself from this coronavirus (and other viruses) include: Washing your hands frequently and thoroughly, using
                    soap and hot water. Avoiding close contact with people who are sick, sneezing or coughing. In addition, you can avoid spreading your own germs by coughing into the crook of your elbow and staying home when you are sick.</p>

                    Myth 9: A face mask will protect you from COVID-19.</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    Fact : Certain models of professional, tight-fitting respirators (such as the N95)can protect health care workers as they care for infected patients . For the general public without respiratory illness, wearing lightweight disposable surgical masks is
                    not recommended. Because they don’t fit tightly, they may allow tiny infected droplets to get into the nose, mouth or eyes. Also, people with the virus on their hands who touch their face under a mask might become infected.</p>

                    Fact :SARS-CoV-2 causes illness that does, indeed, have flu-like symptoms, such as aches, fever, and cough. Similarly, both COVID-19 and flu can be mild, severe, or, in rare cases, fatal. Both can also lead to pneumonia.</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Fact :This statement is untrue. As we have mentioned above, COVID-19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people.The WHO also report that around 80% of people will experience a relatively mild form of the disease, which will not require specialist
                    treatment in a hospital.Mild symptoms may include fever, cough, sore throat, tiredness, and shortness of breath.
